Welcome to Pydash!

PyDash is a text-based horse racing betting game developed in Python. 
The game allows players to bet points on a selected horse and watch a simulated race. 
Each horse is displayed with a unique name and color, and the race outcome is determined randomly. 
The game tracks the player’s points and updates them after every race based on the result.
The game provides a simple console-based interface that displays available horses, current player points, betting options, and race results.

How to Play: 

Choose a horse, place your bet, and start the race. The game randomly determines the winner. Points increase if you win and decrease if you lose.
